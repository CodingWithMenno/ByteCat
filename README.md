Welcome to the ByteCat graphics engine!

!! This project is still in a very early stage of development !!


# üöÄ Future plans
The ultimate goal for this project is to build an acutal usable and enjoyable to work with graphics engine  
with a simple and easy to navigate user interface. Aside from this the ByteCat engine should always be  
very easy to work with as a regular software engineer and for this reason will stay very code focussed.

A few other big goals for this project are to add solid VR and Vulkan support!


# üèÉ Getting started
ByteCat is currently only supported and tested for Windows and Linux.  
For Windows users, using Visual Studio as development environment is recommended!

### Cloning the repository
Start by cloning the repository with the command:  
``` git clone --recursive https://github.com/M-e-n-n-o/ByteCat ``` 

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use the following command to clone the submodules:  
```git submodule update --init``` 

### Setting up the build system
Start by downloading the newest version of premake from: https://premake.github.io.  
After that you only have to build the project by running premke from the root folder of ByteCat.  
For more information about running premake see: https://premake.github.io/docs/Building-Premake


# üìΩÔ∏è Already created projects in ByteCat
Despite the fact that the engine is not that big yet, a few fairly small projects have already  
been built to test the capabilities of the engine.
